Custom View
===========
Why to create CustomView
1. There is no system provided view that fullfil requirement.
2. Performance :- If we have lots of view in a layout and want to optimize it by drawing a single custom view to make it lighter.
3. A big view hierarcy that is complex to operate and support.
4. A complete custom view that required manual drawing.

How to animate custom view ??

View LifeCycle
============
        Custructor
        parent call addView
          onAttachToWindow
          measure
          onMeasure
          layout
          onLayout
          dispatchDraw
          draw
          onDraw


          if invalidate  then it view call--- > onDraw()
          if requestLayout  then view call from  onMeasure()-->onLayout()-->onDraw()


        Custructor() :- Every View starts its life from constructor. Here all initial drawing, various calculation and setting default
                       value is done.

                       We can use AttributeSet interface to setup view with some static parameter.
                       we create attr.xml file  and set attr name and value

        onAttachToWindow() :- After Parent view called addView() that view will be attached to a window.
                            At this stage our view will know other view that is surrounded by.
                            If our view is working with other view defined in same layout, it is best place to find them by id.

        OnMeasure() :- Means our Custom View is on stage and need to find out its own size. Its very important method as for most case
                        our view need to have specific size to fit into layout.


        onLayout() :- Incorporate assigning size and position of each of its children.

        onDraw() :- It will draw view in the window.
                    Having both Paint and Canvs Object will allow to draw anything.

                    Canvas Object comes as onDraw Parameter. It will draw the shape of view.
                    Paint object will give color to view.

                    OnDraw() method get called lots of times. So avoid creating object allocation in it.Create once and reuse further on.


        View Update
        ==========
        invalidate :- View will redraw itself. onDraw() method will get called.
        requestLayout :- View will call onMeasure() as new size need to calculate. What follow after that will onLayout() and onDraw()
                        method call.


        Animation:-
                Animation in custom view is frame by frame process.
                Call invalidate() method after every
